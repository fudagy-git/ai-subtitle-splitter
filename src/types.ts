// This file can be used to define shared types across the application.
// For example:

export interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Currently, the main types (SrtEntry) are co-located in their respective services
// for simplicity. If the app grows, this file would be a good place to centralize them.
